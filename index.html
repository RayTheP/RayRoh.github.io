    <h2>What will happen once you get there?</h2>
    <p>Once you get off your flight into the airport, there will be a crowd of people waiting for boats to come pick them up, since that Maldives is an island. You would've booked a hotel on an island. A person will come pick you up and take you on the boat ride of your life. Once you see the sea, you will just think its normal. However, a few minutes later into your boat ride, the water will get more shallow. This makes a <strong> "BEAUTIFUL" </strong> emerald green. You will not believe your eyes.
    </p>
    <h2>What do you see?</h2>
    <p>When you get to your hotel, you will most likely see a bunch of wooden shacks that are right above the shallow water. Since there are no buildings, the shacks are there one by one and someone might take you to your room on a golf cart. When you get inside your hotel, it is nothing that you thought of. It is not dirty at all, (from where i was staying) and it is very luxurious. There is an outside patio where there is a net you can rest on. There are steps down to the shallow water that connects to the ocean. It truly is a sight. If you look forward, all you will see is endless ocean.

    <h2>What will you do?</h2>
    <p>
    After you have seen everything, you will now probably have fun and play. For the most basic thing, you can just simply play in the sand. There is sand right on the island. Next, there are boats that you can ride on for fun, and for more ecstacy, you can ride a banana boat attached to the boat and try to hang on! Even after all this, it is not <strong>EVEN CLOSE</strong>to the most fun thing. The best thing to do there is to snorkel. There is an ocean right in front of you and you can walk down steps and its there. A bunch of coral reef is also there and you can see many different types of fish. I was scared to go at first, but after I saw all the beautiful things in the ocean, I didn't feel any fear.
